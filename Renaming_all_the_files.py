# Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to 
# generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods 
# youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.
# *********************************************************************************************************************************

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
old = '.hpp'
new = '.h'
newfilenames = []
for file in filenames:
    i = file.replace(old, new)
    newfilenames.append(i)
       
print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
